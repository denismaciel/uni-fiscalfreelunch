### Denis Maciel and Tobias Mueller -   August 22, 2016



````
The document provides a short explication on how to run the Dynare Code
to generate the results of the replication of Erceg and Linde (2014):
````

1. Unzip the Zip file and save the six different Mod-Files in a directory
2. Open Dynare and the main Mod-File "nk_baby_model"
3. Enable in the lower part of the file the desired Figure of the main paper, you would like to replicate
  -  Change the value of the monetary policy rule on output to 15 to generate Figure 1 "Immediate Rise in Government Spending (No Inflation Response)"
  - Change the Calvo parameter to the provided values to generate the Figures with alternative price contract durations
  - Enable the adjustments to the y-axis in the Mod-File "Figure2" and change the title to "xx Quarter Price Contracts" to get the correct Impulse Response Figure of the main paper

- Figure3 step function ??
